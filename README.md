# Bets 2 Make app

Bets web application

# Get Started

1. **Install the packages**  

    `npm install` or `yarn`

2. **Run the app** 

    `npm start` or `yarn start`

3. **Run the setup script**

    `npm run setup` or `yarn setup`

    This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
